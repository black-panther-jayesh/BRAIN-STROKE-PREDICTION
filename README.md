# BrainStroke-Risk-Predictor
In this project, the goal is to use machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of stroke. The project involves collecting data on various risk factors such as age, gender, medical history, lifestyle factors, and blood pressure. The data will be preprocessed and suitable machine learning algorithms will be selected to build a predictive model. The aim is to improve our understanding of stroke risk factors and contribute to the development of more effective prevention strategies. The project emphasizes early detection and timely intervention to improve patient outcomes for this life-threatening condition.

## Problem Statement
Developing a machine learning model to predict the risk of stroke based on various risk factors. Early detection and intervention are crucial for improving patient outcomes. Challenges include collecting relevant patient data, identifying important risk factors, selecting suitable machine learning algorithms, preprocessing data, evaluating model performance, and developing a user-friendly interface. The goal is to provide a reliable tool for healthcare professionals to predict stroke risk and make informed decisions, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

## Features
- Collects comprehensive data on various risk factors such as age, gender, medical history, lifestyle factors, and blood pressure.
- Preprocesses and cleans the data to handle missing values, outliers, and data quality issues.
- Selects suitable machine learning algorithms to build a robust predictive model.
- Evaluates the performance of the model using appropriate metrics and optimizations.
- Provides a user-friendly interface to input patient data and obtain risk predictions.
- Contributes to the development of more efficient prevention strategies and interventions.
